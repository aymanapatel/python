:toc:
:icons: font

== Foundations

=== Initial setup of `asyncio` service

=== Boilerplate code




== Graceful shutdowns

=== What is signal handler is, why it's needed

=== What signals to listen to

=== Gotchas of cancelling tasks, `asyncio.shield` + shutdown behaviour

== Exception Handling

=== Difference between top-level exceptions and handling within other coroutins

=== Avoid mistakenly swallowing/missing raised exceptions

=== Making use of `loop.set_exception_handler`


== Making threaded code `asyncio` FRIENDLY

1. Calling threaded code from coroutines (aka running within a `ThreadPoolExecutor`) 

2. Calling coroutines from threaded code (aka running within a `run_coroutine_threadsafe`) 
 

== Testing `asyncio` code 


=== Debug mode

=== How to mock **coroutines**

== Debugging an `asyncio` service




=== Debug mode


=== Tricks

1. `ayncio.all_tasks` with logging

2. `loop.slow_callback_duration` 

3. Adding context/stack trace in default exception handler

== Profiling

=== Basic Profiling


==== Profilers

1. **cProfile**
2. **strace**


== Continous Profiling

OSS 3rd party tools

== Pycharm's `asyncio` and thread and profiler

== How to properly trace a workflow/request
